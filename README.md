# TTT4275 - Classification project
This project is part of the course TTT4275.
The task is to implement classifiers to determine the genres of a set of music tracks.

## The task

### Part 1
(a) Design a k-NN classifier (with k = 5) for all ten genres using only the following four features: spectral rolloff mean, mfcc 1 mean, spec- tral centroid mean and tempo.

(b) Evaluate the performance of the classifier by finding the confusion matrix and the error rate for the test set.

(c) Discuss some of the misclassified tracks. Do you as a human agree with the classifier for some of the incorrect classifications?

### Part 2
(a) For each of the four features; spectral rolloff mean, mfcc 1 mean, spectral centroid mean and tempo, compare the feature distribution for the four classes: pop, disco, metal and classical. Do this by producing histograms for each of the listed features and classes. An- alyze how the feature distribution relates to the performance of your classifier by taking away the feature which shows most overlap be- tween the classes. Train and test a classifier with the remaining three features.

(b) Compare the confusion matrices and the error rates for the four ex- periments and comment on the property of the features with respect to linear separability both as a whole and for the four separate classes.

### Part 3
(a) Design a k-NN classifier (k=5) for all ten genres using only four fea- tures with at least three features chosen among spectral rolloff mean, mfcc 1 mean, spectral centroid mean, and tempo.

(b) Motivate why you selected the particular four features.

(c) Generate the confusion matrix, compute the error rates and discuss the results.

### Part 4
(a) Design a classifier for all ten genres that classifies the audio tracks, each represented by a Track ID. You are allowed to use any classifier, as many features as you like and all of the available data sets Genre- ClassData 5s.txt, GenreClassData 10s.txt, and GenreClassData 30s.txt as input data.

(b) Generate the confusion matrix, compute the error rates

(c) Justify your choices and discuss the results.
